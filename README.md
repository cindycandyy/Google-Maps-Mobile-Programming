# Tugas 8 - Google Maps Integration (Mobile Programming)
## 📍 Overview
This project is an Android application that integrates Google Maps, allowing users to search for locations, move to specific coordinates, and calculate distances between two points. It uses Google Maps API for mapping and location services

# 🚀 Features
- Display a map with a default marker at ITS (Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember)
- Search for locations using Geocoder
- Move to a specified latitude and longitude with a zoom level
- Calculate the distance between two locations
- Draw a route between two points using Google Directions API

# 🛠️ Requirements
- Android Studio
- Google Maps API Key

# 🏗️ How It Works
- The app loads a map and centers it on ITS
- Users can enter a location name to search for its coordinates
- Users can enter latitude, longitude, and zoom level to move the camera to a specific location
- The app calculates the distance between ITS and the searched location
- A route is drawn between ITS and the searched location using Google Directions API
